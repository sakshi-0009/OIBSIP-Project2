# OIBSIP-Project2 : Number Guessing Game


__Oasis Infobyte Internship - Task 2 :-__

Completed Task 2 of name Number Guessing Game in Java Peogramming language using Eclipse IDE.

Steps Required :

1. In this implementation, we first create a Scanner object to read input from the user and a Random object to generate a random number between 1 and 100, inclusive.

2. We then use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for a guess until they correctly guess the number. We keep track of the number of tries it takes the user to guess the number by incrementing a tries variable each time through the loop.

3. Inside the loop, we use if statements to determine whether the user's guess is too high or too low, or if they've guessed the correct number. If the user guesses correctly, we print a congratulatory message and display the number of tries it took.

4. Finally, we close the Scanner object to free up system resources.

I hope this helps you create your own number guessing game in Java!
